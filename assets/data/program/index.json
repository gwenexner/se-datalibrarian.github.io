As qualitative researchers writing such plans frequently ask for examples of excellent DMPs for qualitative research, we hoped that this competition would assemble a trove of exemplar DMPs that we could share with the research community. Three expert judges reviewed each entry.  They assessed DMPs on a an 18-item rubric based on the DART Project as well as guidance from the DMPTool. Based on these reviews, the organizers selected 11 prize-winning DMPs and shared them with the research data management community to use as examples. This short talk will review insights garnered from the competition and discuss potential additional uses for the review rubric designed for the project.

The overall concept was to enable researchers to improve data use and re-use for collaborators and themselves, use available technical tools to create reproducible workflows, and more easily communicate and disseminate findings and data. Technical sessions covered version control and R Studio tools; non-technical sessions covered file and metadata organization and data sharing. We launched it as a standalone mini-series within our ongoing data workshop series.  We leveraged a relatively varied skillset among library staff to present these sessions. Data, code, and more information is openly available. While graduate students were the most common attendee type, we had a significant number of post-docs and research staff attend our sessions. Feedback collected via follow-up surveys was generally positive prompting us to offer the series again this Fall.

Data sharing is now becoming an expectation in scientific research. This paper will survey the landscape of data sharing policy from funders, publishers, and universities and will take from those policies to suggest changes to the UNC SILS master’s paper/project policy to include a data sharing component, namely, a data management plan and a data availability statement. In order to assist students following the new policy and sharing data if desired, this project will create a libguide outlining best practices for data sharing and a step by step process to share data at UNC SILS.","YouTubeLink":"","materialsLink":"https://osf.io/rkn2w/"}},{"node":{"id":"57677523","day":"Thu, Oct 14","session":"p3_thurs","lengthMin":"90","startTimeEDT":"1:00 PM","endTimeEDT":"2:30 PM","type":"Posters","title":"Data Literacy as Critical Information Literacy: Teaching Both via the Frame “Information Creation as a Process”","presenters":"Julia Bauder (Grinnell College)","abstract":"Data literacy involves two sets of skills: (1) a basic technical literacy that allows the student to understand the meaning that a given data representation is attempting to convey and (2) a critical literacy that allows the student to understand how power, authority, and conscious human choices play a large part in determining what the data “says.” The frame “Information Creation as a Process” from the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education provides a structure for teaching both aspects of data literacy at once, as students are guided through the creation of simple data visualizations or data analyses and encouraged to explore how making different choices can lead to very different results, even when all of the choices made are reasonable and valid. This talk will highlight some examples from the literature of this type of data literacy instruction.","YouTubeLink":"","materialsLink":"https://osf.io/gjwy8/"}},{"node":{"id":"32340fb8","day":"Thu, Oct 14","session":"p3_thurs","lengthMin":"90","startTimeEDT":"1:00 PM","endTimeEDT":"2:30 PM","type":"Posters","title":"Visualizing Global Tweet Activity for NIH Covid-19 Preprints","presenters":"Levi Dolan (National Library of Medicine)","abstract":"As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the focus on preprint articles as a means of rapid research dissemination has sharply intensified.  Produced as part of a larger project examining public comments on preprint articles, this poster breaks down an automated method which was used to gather geographic information via an Altmetric API for the 200k+ Tweets about 1,000 of the first articles in the NIH Preprint Pilot.  The workflow in gathering the information for a final visualization is explained, with the results visualized as a global map overlaid with a scatterplot.","YouTubeLink":"","materialsLink":"https://osf.io/z49xu/"}},{"node":{"id":"17a05bc8","day":"Thu, Oct 14","session":"p3_thurs","lengthMin":"90","startTimeEDT":"1:00 PM","endTimeEDT":"2:30 PM","type":"Posters","title":"Propel: UVa Library Working with Career Services","presenters":"Nancy Kechner (University of Virginia)","abstract":"UVa Library's Research Data Services (RDS) worked with Career Services on a virtual Summer Internship for undergraduate students to teach Data Literacy and Data Visualization using Tableau.

This workshop will show you how to use free and open source tools to access data from the Crossref publication data API. We will review the features of Crossref as a data source, walk through the two Python libraries you’ll need to access the API (Pandas and Requests), and talk about different freely available visualization software including Microsoft Power BI and Google Data Studio. We will code together in real time using Google Colab Jupyter Notebooks and leave you with example code that you can begin modifying to pull data relevant to your institution.","YouTubeLink":"","materialsLink":"https://osf.io/bfhps/"}}]}},"context":{}}
